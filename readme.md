## Description ##

The widget appearance mimics the members box in GitHub org page. You just simply enter GitHub organization for the widget to show off the GitHub org members in a widget. There's filter `gh_members_showoff_widget_view_path` to change view path of the widget.

To use the shortcode, use `[gh_members_showoff org="Automattic" limit="10" order_username="asc"]`. The required attribute is `org`, the rest is optional. This will render member listing of specified org. You can change the view path of rendered member listing via `gh_members_showoff_shortcode_view_path` filter.

If you want to display member listing via plugin or theme, you can use:

```
<?php do_action( 'gh_members_showoff', array( 'org' => 'GitHub' ) ); ?>
```

The same attributes on shortcode apply too.

This plugin depends on [GitHub API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/github-api/) plugin. Make sure to install and activate that first.

**Development of this plugin is done on [GitHub](https://github.com/gedex/wp-gh-members-showoff). Pull requests are always welcome**.
